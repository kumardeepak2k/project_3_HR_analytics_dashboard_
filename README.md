# HR Analytics Dashboard: Understanding Employee Attrition Trends  

## 📌 Overview  
Employee attrition is one of the most critical challenges for any organization, as it directly impacts productivity, morale, and overall business performance. To tackle this, I created an **HR Analytics Dashboard** using **Power BI** to provide key insights into employee turnover patterns and help leadership make informed decisions to improve employee retention. This dashboard explores attrition across various factors such as **education**, **age**, **department**, **salary**, and **years of service** — offering a comprehensive view of the driving forces behind employee exits.

## 🚀 Project Objective  
The goal of this project was to identify the key drivers of employee attrition and provide actionable insights to reduce turnover rates. The dashboard was designed to:  
✅ Analyze overall attrition trends and patterns.  
✅ Break down attrition by demographic and professional factors (e.g., department, salary, education).  
✅ Provide interactive filters for deeper analysis and targeted decision-making.  
✅ Help leadership develop effective retention strategies.
